# Ouvidor Digital's front-end app architecture & project structure

This repo contains an example app developed using a feature based, Vertical Slice-inspired architecture. The main goal is creating a model for what a modern, developer-friendly React project structure should be like. This is the chosen structure for all of Ouvidor Digital's front-end applications that are based on React.
